# BOSCore Documentation

The BOS Network is committed to providing users with easy-to-access and easy-to-use blockchain services, providing a more user-friendly infrastructure for DApp operations, working to support richer application scenarios, and actively experimenting booms in DApp development. In addition to technical improvements, the BOS Network will also make attempts to improve in other areas. For example, in order to increase the level of participation of users in voting, estimator technology can be used to incentive accounts that meet certain predefined parameters.
